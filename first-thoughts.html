        <h1>Meta Design System</h1>
        <p>A design system for creating design systems.</p>
        <p>The first version of Meta Design System [MDS] will use the Codecademy Personal Profile Website Portfolio Project as an example. MDS will define the process to be followed in creating design systems for use in other/upcoming Codecademy projects. MDS is both a template for and an example of the process.</p>

                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>The DS is a dynamic document. It is stable enough to be useful yet fluid enough to both lead and reflect the state of the organisation and its online presence.</p>

                <h2>Brand Vision and Values</h2>
                <p>The DS seeks to reflect the vision and values of the entity for whom it is created</p>

                <p>
                    These May seem obvious as stock tools of the trade. They are included in part for completeness and in part so that the DS makes clear how they are used, at what point in the process they are used and how they are used at different stages.
